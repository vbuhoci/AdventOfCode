== 🎄 What is this?

It is a collection of my quickly made up solutions for the puzzles found each year in https://adventofcode.com[Advent of Code].

IMPORTANT: The pieces of source code for these puzzles are not meant to be perfect, optimised for speed or resource usage - only that they output the correct answer for the given exercises.

== 🎀 Progression

NOTE: a.k.a number of stars ⭐ collected each year.

Each puzzle has two parts and solving one part gives one star, thus 2 stars per exercise.
